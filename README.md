# Airline passenger satisfaction project
The dataset on which the analysis was performed comes from kaggle.com (link: https://bit.ly/3InJAfB). The database was created as a result of an airline passenger satisfaction survey. It contains 129880 records, each represented by 24 explanatory variables and 1 classifier variable. The main business objective of this analysis is to answer the question:

**Which characteristics affect airline passenger satisfaction the most?**

In order to do that I used K-means and Decision tree algorithms. Check out my R script file to find out how it went :)
